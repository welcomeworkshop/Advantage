      <p class="lead">The AdvantAge Initiative (AI) is a project of the Center for Home Care Policy and Research (CHCPR) of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY) that began in 1999 with support from the Archstone Foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies, the Hartford Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Retirement Research Foundation, and the Fan Fox and Leslie R. Samuels Foundation. Since then, the AdvantAge Initiative has been helping communities throughout the country use the Advantage Initiative process to learn about older adults’ perceptions of and experiences in their communities; identify barriers to “aging in place;” and plan for action to make their communities better places to live for older adults and their families.</p>

<p>National and local surveys of people 60+ in the U.S. have overwhelmingly shown that older adults would like to stay in their homes and communities as they grow older.  Older adults, in fact, are the least likely segment of the population to move. Most stay put in their communities for a variety of reasons, including the desire to be near loved ones, financial considerations, and close attachment to their neighborhoods, homes, and friends and neighbors.
But are the communities where older adults live able to support them as they grow older?  Throughout the country, most communities were not designed specifically for an older population that wants to age in place. In suburban areas, for example, where the usual means of transportation is the automobile, older adults may become isolated when they can no longer drive.  In cities, available, affordable housing stock may be limited and inappropriate for older adults, such as walk-up apartment buildings and homes where the only bathroom is on the second floor.   </p>

<p>Over the past 10 years, the population 65 and over increased from 36.6 million in 2005 to 47.8 million in 2015 (a 30% increase) and is projected to more than double to 98 million in 2060.  Organizations throughout the nation are realizing that they need to make their communities more aging friendly to accommodate these changing demographics.</p> 

<p>The AdvantAge Initiative helps communities by providing:</p>

<uL>
  <li>An original framework that defines the four domains of an aging-friendly community</li>

<li>A set of indicators that are used to measure how well communities are supporting older residents’ needs</li>
<li>A consumer survey questionnaire that is used to capture older adults’ experiences in and perceptions of their community, as well as their priorities </li>

<li>A process to engage community stakeholders and get their buy-in</li>
<li>Technical assistance to help organizations conduct the Initiative in their communities</li>
</ul>
